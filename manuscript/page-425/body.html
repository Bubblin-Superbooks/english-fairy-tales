<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Xxviii. Johnny-cake.</h3><p class="  start-chapter"><em>Source</em>.—<em>American Journal of Folk-Lore</em>, ii. 60.</p><p><em>Parallels</em>.—Another variant is given in the same <em>Journal</em>, p. 277, where reference is also made to a version “The Gingerbread Boy,” in <em>St. Nicholas</em>, May 1875. Chambers gives two versions of the same story, under the title “The Wee Bunnock,” the first of which is one of the most dramatic and humorous of folk-tales. Unfortunately, the Scotticisms are so frequent as to render the droll practically untranslatable. “The Fate of Mr. Jack Sparrow” in <em>Uncle Remus</em> is similar to that of Johnny-Cake.</p></div> </div>
