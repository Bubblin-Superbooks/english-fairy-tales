Home came the giant, and a great big tree in his hand, and he took down the sack, and began to batter it. His wife cried, “It's me, man;” but the dog barked and the cat mewed, and he did not know his wife's voice. But Molly came out from the back of the door, and the giant saw her, and he after her; and he ran and she ran, till they came to the “Bridge of one hair,” and she got over but he couldn't; and he said, “Woe worth you, Molly Whuppie! never you come again.” “Never more, carle,” quoth she, “will I come again to Spain.”</p><p>So Molly took the ring to the king, and she was married to his youngest son, and she never saw the giant again.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
