<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">enough for the table.</p><p><em>Remarks</em>.—Mr. Miacca seems to have played the double <em>rôle</em> of a domestic Providence. He not alone punished bad boys, as here, but also rewarded the good, by leaving them gifts on appropriate occasions like Santa Claus or Father Christmas, who, as is well known, only leave things for good children. Mrs. Abrahams remembers one occasion well when she nearly caught sight of Mr. Miacca, just after he had left her a gift; she saw his shadow in the shape of a bright light passing down the garden.</p></div> </div>
