<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Notes And References</h4><p class="  start-chapter">In the following notes I give first the <em>source</em> whence I obtained the various tales. Then come <em>parallels</em> in some fulness for the United Kingdom, but only a single example for foreign countries, with a bibliographical reference where further variants can be found. Finally, a few <em>remarks</em> are sometimes added where the tale seems to need it. In two cases (Nos. xvi. and xxi.) I have been more full.</p></div> </div>
