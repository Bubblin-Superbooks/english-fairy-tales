At last a funny-looking old gentleman engaged her, and took her home to his house. When she got there, he told her that he had something to teach her, for that in his house he had his own names for things.</p><p>He said to her: “What will you call me?”</p><p>“Master or mister, or whatever you please sir,” says she.</p><p>He said: “You must call me 'master of all masters.' And what would you call this?” pointing to his bed.</p><p>“Bed or couch, or whatever you please, sir.”</p></div> </div>
