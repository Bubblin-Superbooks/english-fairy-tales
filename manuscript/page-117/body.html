So the wolf came, as he did to the other little pigs, and said:</p><p>“Little pig, little pig, let me come in.”</p><p>“No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.”</p><p>“Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in.”</p><p>Well, he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and huffed; but he could <em>not</em> get the house down. When he found that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he said:</p><p>“Little pig, I know where there is a nice field of turnips.”</p></div> </div>
