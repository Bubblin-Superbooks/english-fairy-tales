I have reduced the adventurers from three to two, and cut down the herds and their answers. I have substituted riddles from the first English collection of riddles, <em>The Demandes Joyous</em> of Wynkyn de Worde, for the poor ones of the original, which are besides not solved. “Ettin” is the English spelling of the word, as it is thus spelt in a passage of Beaumont and Fletcher (<em>Knight of Burning Pestle</em>, i. 1), which may refer to this very story, which, as we shall see, is quite as old as their time.</p></div> </div>
