<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>“Little pig, there is a fair at Shanklin this afternoon, will you go?”</p><p>“Oh yes,” said the pig, “I will go; what time shall you be ready?”</p><p>“At three,” said the wolf. So the little pig went off before the time as usual, and got to the fair, and bought a butter-churn, which he was going home with, when he saw the wolf coming. Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into the churn to hide, and by so doing turned it round, and it rolled down the hill with the pig in it, which frightened the wolf so much, that he ran home without going to the fair. He went to the little pig's house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him. Then the little pig said:</p><p>“Hah, I frightened you, then. I had been to the fair and bought a butter-churn, and when I saw you, I got into it, and rolled down the hill.”</p></div> </div>
