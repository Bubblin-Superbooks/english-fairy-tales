I have eliminated a malodorous and un-English skunk.</p><p><em>Parallels</em>.—Two other versions are given in the <em>Journal l.c.</em> One of these, however, was probably derived from Grimm's “Town Musicians of Bremen” (No. 27). That the others came from across the Atlantic is shown by the fact that it occurs in Ireland (Kennedy, <em>Fictions</em>, pp. 5-10) and Scotland (Campbell, No. 11). For other variants, see R. Köhler in Gonzenbach, <em>Sicil. Märchen</em>, ii. 245.</p></div> </div>
