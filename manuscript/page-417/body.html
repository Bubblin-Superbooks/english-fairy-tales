<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p><em>Parallels</em>.—“The Red Etin” is referred to in <em>The Complaynt of Scotland</em>, about 1548. It has some resemblance to “Childe Rowland,” which see. The “death index,” as we may call tokens that tell the state of health of a parted partner, is a usual incident in the theme of the Two Brothers, and has been studied by the Grimms, i. 421, 453; ii. 403; by Köhler on Campbell, <em>Occ. u. Or.</em>, ii. 119-20; on Gonzenbach, ii. 230; on Bladé, 248; by Cosquin, <em>l.c.</em>, i. 70-2, 193; by Crane, <em>Ital. Pop. Tales</em>, 326; and by Jones and Kropf, <em>Magyar Tales</em>, 329. Riddles generally come in the form of the “riddle-bride-wager” (<em>cf.</em> Child, <em>Ballads</em>, i. 415-9; ii. 519), when the hero or heroine wins a spouse by guessing a riddle or riddles. Here it is the simpler Sphinx form of the “riddle task,” on which see Köhler in <em>Jahrb. rom. Phil.</em>, vii. 273, and on Gonzenbach, 215.</p></div> </div>
