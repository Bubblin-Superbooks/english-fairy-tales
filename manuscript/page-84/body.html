  Binnorie, O Binnorie;
And yonder sits my mother, the queen;
  By the bonny mill-dams o' Binnorie,
“And yonder stands my brother Hugh,
  Binnorie, O Binnorie;
And by him, my William, false and true;
  By the bonny mill-dams o' Binnorie.”
Then they all wondered, and the harper told them how he had seen the princess lying drowned on the bank near the bonny mill-dams o' Binnorie, and how he had afterwards made this harp out of her hair and breast-bone. Just then the harp began singing again, and this was what it sang out loud and clear:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“And there sits my sister who drownèd me
By the bonny mill-dams o' Binnorie.”
And the harp snapped and broke, and never sang more.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
