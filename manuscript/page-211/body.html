And she had two sons; and by-and-by it was time for the wife to send them away to seek their fortune. So she told her eldest son one day to take a can and bring her water from the well, that she might bake a cake for him; and however much or however little water he might bring, the cake would be great or small accordingly, and that cake was to be all that she could give him when he went on his travels.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The lad went away with the can to the well, and filled it with water, and then came away home again;</p></div> </div>
