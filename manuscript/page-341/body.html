<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">from the Well of the World's End, and I can't fill it no how at all.”</p><p>“Well,” said the frog, “if you promise me to do whatever I bid you for a whole night long, I'll tell you how to fill it.”</p><p>So the girl agreed, and then the frog said:</p><blockquote><p>“Stop it with moss and daub it with clay,
And then it will carry the water away;”
and then it gave a hop, skip and jump, and went flop into the Well of the World's End.</p></blockquote><p>So the girl looked about for some moss, and lined the bottom of the sieve with it, and over that she put some clay, and then she dipped it once again into the Well of the World's End; and this time, the water didn't run out, and she turned to go away.</p></div> </div>
