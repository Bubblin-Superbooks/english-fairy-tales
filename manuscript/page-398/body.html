<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>The “Fee-fi-fo-fum” formula is common to all English stories of giants and ogres; it also occurs in Peele's play and in <em>King Lear</em> (see note on “Childe Rowland”). Messrs. Jones and Kropf have some remarks on it in their “Magyar Tales,” pp. 340-1; so has Mr. Lang in his “Perrault,” p. lxiii., where he traces it to the Furies in Aeschylus' <em>Eumenides</em>.</p></div> </div>
