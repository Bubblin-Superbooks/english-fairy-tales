Five pounds, ten, fifteen, no, it can't be twenty.”</p><p>“I told you you couldn't guess, what do you say to these beans; they're magical, plant them over-night and——”</p><p>“What!” says Jack's mother, “have you been such a fool, such a dolt, such an idiot, as to give away my Milky-white, the best milker in the parish, and prime beef to boot, for a set of paltry beans. Take that! Take that! Take that! And as for your precious beans here they go out of the window. And now off with you to bed. Not a sup shall you drink, and not a bit shall you swallow this very night.”</p><p>So Jack went upstairs to his little room in the attic, and sad and sorry he was, to be sure, as much for his mother's sake, as for the loss of his supper.</p><p>At last he dropped off to sleep.</p></div> </div>
