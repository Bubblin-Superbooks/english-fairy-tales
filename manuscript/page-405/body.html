Now this is a form of writing not unknown in other branches of literature, the <em>cante-fable</em>, of which “Aucassin et Nicolette” is the most distinguished example. Nor is the <em>cante-fable</em> confined to France. Many of the heroic verses of the Arabs contained in the <em>Hamâsa</em> would be unintelligible without accompanying narrative, which is nowadays preserved in the commentary. The verses imbedded in the <em>Arabian Nights</em> give them something of the character of a <em>cante-fable</em>, and the same may be said of the Indian and Persian story-books, though the verse is usually of a sententious and moral kind, as in the <em>gâthas</em> of the Buddhist Jatakas. Even as remote as Zanzibar, Mr. Lang notes, the folk-tales are told as <em>cante-fables</em>. There are even traces in the Old Testament of such screeds of verse amid the prose narrative, as in the story of Lamech or that of Balaam. All this suggests that this is a very early and common form of narrative.</p></div> </div>
