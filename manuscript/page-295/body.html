<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">nine times nine she cast Princess Margaret under her spell. And this was her spell:</p><blockquote><p>I weird ye to be a Laidly Worm,
  And borrowed shall ye never be,
Until Childe Wynd, the King's own son
  Come to the Heugh and thrice kiss thee;
Until the world comes to an end,
  Borrowed shall ye never be.
So Lady Margaret went to bed a beauteous maiden, and rose up a Laidly Worm. And when her maidens came in to dress her in the morning they found coiled up on the bed a dreadful dragon, which uncoiled itself and came towards them. But they ran away shrieking, and the Laidly Worm crawled and crept, and crept and crawled till it reached the Heugh or rock of the Spindlestone, round which it coiled itself, and lay there basking with its terrible snout in the air.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
