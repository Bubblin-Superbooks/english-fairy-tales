They were very poor, and the old woman got her living by spinning, but Jack was so lazy that he would do nothing but bask in the sun in the hot weather, and sit by the corner of the hearth in the winter-time. So they called him Lazy Jack. His mother could not get him to do anything for her, and at last told him, one Monday, that if he did not begin to work for his porridge she would turn him out to get his living as he could.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">This roused Jack, and he went out and hired himself for the next day to a neighbouring farmer for a penny;</p></div> </div>
