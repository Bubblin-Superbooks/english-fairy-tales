The first is that of the Valiant Tailor (Grimm, No. 20); to this belong the incidents of the fleabite blows (for variants of which see Köhler in <em>Jahrb. rom. eng. Phil.</em>, viii. 252), and that of the slit paunch (<em>cf.</em> Cosquin, <em>l.c.</em>, ii. 51). The Thankful Dead episode, where the hero is assisted by the soul of a person whom he has caused to be buried, is found as early as the <em>Cento novelle antiche</em> and Straparola, xi. 2. It has been best studied by Köhler in <em>Germania</em>, iii. 199-209 (<em>cf.</em> Cosquin, i. 214-5; ii. 14 and note; and Crane, <em>Ital. Pop. Tales</em>, 350, note 12). It occurs also in the curious play of Peele's <em>The Old Wives' Tale</em>, in which one of the characters is the Ghost of Jack. Practically the same story as this part of Jack the Giant-Killer occurs in Kennedy, <em>Fictions of the Irish Celts</em>, p. 32, “Jack the Master and Jack the Servant;” and Kennedy adds (p. 38), “In some versions Jack the Servant is the spirit of the buried man.”</p></div> </div>
